## 📂 Tasks & Projects Included

### **Task 1 – Network Scanning using Nmap**
Performed network reconnaissance to identify live hosts, open ports, and running services, understanding how network-level information is gathered.

### **Task 2 – Firewall Configuration (UFW)**
Configured firewall rules on a Linux system using UFW to allow or block network traffic, demonstrating basic access control and system security.

### **Task 3 – SQL Injection Analysis (DVWA)**
Practiced SQL injection techniques in a controlled lab environment (DVWA) to understand common web application vulnerabilities and secure coding importance.

### **Task 4 – Research Report on Network Security Threats**
Prepared a detailed research report covering common threats such as DoS/DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, spoofing techniques, their impacts, and prevention methods.

### **Task 5 – Social Engineering Awareness**
Analyzed common social engineering techniques to understand how attackers exploit human behavior and why user awareness is critical in cybersecurity.

### **Task 6 – Password Security & Strength Analysis**
Studied password security practices and highlighted the importance of strong authentication mechanisms in preventing unauthorized access.

### **Task 8 – Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark**
Captured and analyzed HTTP network traffic to observe client–server communication, HTTP GET requests, server responses (200 OK, 301 redirects), and packet-level data flow.
