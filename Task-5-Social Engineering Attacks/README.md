## 🔐 Task 5: Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks

📌 **Objective**  
The objective of this task is to research and document various social engineering attacks and understand how attackers exploit human behavior, their impact on organizations and individuals, and the preventive measures used to mitigate these attacks.

📘 **Description**  
In this task, I prepared a detailed research report focusing on major social engineering attacks, including:

- Phishing attacks  
- Pretexting attacks  
- Baiting attacks  
- Tailgating (Piggybacking) attacks  

The report explains:

- How each social engineering attack works  
- Real-world examples and case studies  
- Impact on organizations and individuals  
- Prevention and mitigation techniques  

🛠 **Tools & Concepts Used**  
- Social Engineering Concepts  
- Cybersecurity Awareness & Threat Analysis  
- Human-Centered Security Principles  
- OWASP & CISA Security Guidelines  

📂 **File Included**  
- `social_engineering_report.md` – Detailed research report on social engineering attacks  

✅ **Outcome**  
This task helped me understand how human psychology is exploited in cyberattacks and highlighted the importance of security awareness training, strong authentication mechanisms, and proper verification procedures in preventing social engineering attacks.
